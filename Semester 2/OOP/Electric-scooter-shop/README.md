The application is an electric scooter shop with two user roles: Manager and User. They can add, delete, or edit scooters. Users can search for scooters by location and filter the list by age or mileage. The application offers a choice of volatile or persistent storage mode, with different repositories used depending on the selection. Qt, used for the GUI, displays a table of scooters and their attributes, allowing sorting by columns and selection of a detailed view.
